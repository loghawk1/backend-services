## ✨ What You Get

- ✅ Self-hosted caption generation
- ✅ Railway-hosted video URLs
- ✅ 80-95% cost savings vs json2video
- ✅ 50% faster processing
- ✅ Full control over captioning

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Use in production**: Call `/caption` endpoint from your app
2. **Set up cleanup**: See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for storage management
3. **Monitor**: Watch Railway logs for any issues
4. **Optimize**: Adjust Whisper model size if needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### FFmpeg not found
→ Check `nixpacks.toml` is in project root

### Video not accessible
→ Verify `/videos` endpoint: `curl https://YOUR_APP.railway.app/videos/`

### Out of memory
→ Use smaller Whisper model: Change `"small"` to `"tiny"` in `caption_generation.py`
